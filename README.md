# Clustering Coefficient and Average Clustering Coefficient Calculation for an Unweighted, Undirected Graph
This code computes the clustering coefficient for each node in an undirected, unweighted graph represented by an adjacency matrix. Additionally, the code calculates the average clustering coefficient for the entire graph, which measures overall network clustering.

- Features:
Clustering Coefficient: Calculates the clustering coefficient for a specified node in the graph, based on its neighbors and their interconnections.
Average Clustering Coefficient: Computes the average of the clustering coefficients for all nodes in the graph, providing a global measure of clustering in the network.

- Input:
An adjacency matrix representing the graph (assumed to be undirected and unweighted).

- Output:
Clustering coefficient of the specified node.
Average clustering coefficient for the entire graph.
